Matt Leezer's Project for 2021 Javascript Class

For this project I have continued to bring to light the magical and majestic instrument that is called "The Air Guitar".
Right now I am developing an online retail presence to show and sell many vintage varities of the air guitar, also
along with the financial wing of the website, I wanted to highlight some amazing players, videos, etc.

I have implemented a email input which will be validated by using the regex expression.
The Vault page where the photos are shown was built by using an array to retrieve photos from the interweb.
The Video page uses a YouTube API  and it supposed to read the external JSON file, with certain search parameters to randomly bring up videos that are supposed
to be "Air Guitar" related, but I seemed to have used that term a little loosely.
Lastly I built in a Black Friday Countdown timer on the home page, since everything is revolving around the day after Thanksgiving right now.

Hopefully as I continue to build, refine and polish this website, I will be able to get the word out on this instrument that so many
teenage angst ridden kids have played in their bedrooms, or the numerous drunk frat boys whailing along to the cover band at the local
bar.
