                <h2>Today back in 1983 a little known air guitarist
                named Sven Pickadilly, came blaring on the scene. As the tech for a band named Green Jelly, Sven was called upon to replace their
                lead guitarist for one night at a concert in Nova Scotia. There Sven blew away the crowd with his masterful solos and 
                acrobatics.</h2>
